Welcome to Synchro documentation!
===================================

**Synchro** is a tool for bringing more statistical power to EEG experiments, icreasing control, preventing information loss in brain research due to jittering signals,  and eliminating repetitive frustrating tasks.

**Why** is the synchronization so important? Due to random delays occuring due to technical reasons the stimuly presented to the subject are jittery. Typpically, the signal of brain evoked activity measured by EEG is getting lost.
